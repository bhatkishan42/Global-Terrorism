Data analytics
The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) documents more than 200,000 international and domestic terrorist attacks that occurred worldwide since 1970. 
With details on various dimensions of each attack, the GTD familiarizes analysts, policymakers, scholars, and journalists with patterns of terrorism. 
The GTD defines terrorist attacks as: The threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence by a non-state actor to attain a political, economic, religious, 
or social goal through fear, coercion, or intimidation.Terrorism implies the use of violence to terrorise a population or government for certain political, religious 
or ideological purpose. The threat of terrorism has become a worldwide concern with several parts of the world reeling under frequent terrorist strikes. With little 
concern for human lives, terrorists continue to strike with impunity, leaving a trail of death and destruction, wherever they choose to inflict their blows.
In this dataset, we will be exploring the terror attacks over the world from 1970-2016, finding the most affected countries, the most notorious groups, their motives,etc.
